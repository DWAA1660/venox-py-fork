Steps on how to start bot:
1. Install `pie` version from [PIE-RUST](https://github.com/skandabhairava/pie-rust/releases/tag/main)
2. Fill up pie config by executing `pie cfg`
4. `pie run`, the first time you run it, it will need time to start up a virtual environment and download the required dependencies.
5. Run the above command once again, and the bot *should* crash asking you to fill up the config. Fill up 'config.json' now generated in src/
6. Run the command once again to start the bot. From now onwards, just running `pie run` should start the bot.
